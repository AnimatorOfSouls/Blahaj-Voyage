## CHAPTER 0 - Waking Up ##
It's a brand new day on this wonderful planet, and as the sun rises over the horizon the IKEA warehouse comes to life.
While the workers begin to filter in through the doors, there is some movement from within a storage crate.
A sharp blue nose glides into view, along with two shiny button eyes. The creature spots a label stamped onto a nearby
crate, reading "BLAHAJ". They decide to take this as their name.
Small blue fins slowly make their way out of the crate, and the eyes focus on the warehouse door - could this be
their chance to make a bid for freedom?

Nope.

"Some weirdo bought a whole bunch of these sharks... Haul that crate into the lorry!"
One of the worker reaches up and picks up the crate, slamming the lid shut.
There are some other sharks also stuck in this crate, but none of them seem to be alive. Perhaps Blahaj can
coax a few of them to wake up.
