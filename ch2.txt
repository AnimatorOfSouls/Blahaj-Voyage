## CHAPTER 2 - Transit ##

As the truck pulls away from the warehouse, Blahaj settles into a comfortable position to wait out the ride.
Suddenly, the crate Blahaj is in gets pushed out of position and all the sharks spill out onto the floor.
Looking up, Blahaj notices that some of the boxes are moving, and a small box has taken the place where their crate
used to be. They just got shoved to the ground by some flat-packed furniture...
Blahaj is not willing to take this lying down, and tries to climb back up over various other boxes.
One of the boxes Blahaj just stepped on jumps up and begins to shake menacingly towards Blahaj. Unnerved, Blahaj
tries to push the box down, but then the box starts to fight back.
