## CHAPTER 3 - Destiny ##

The crate that Blahaj is in is picked up by a worker, who walks up the driveway and knocks on the door. The door opens,
revealing that the person in the house is Ryan.
Blahaj and his companions are handed over to Ryan, who sets them in a corner of his room. Ryan walks over to his
computer and starts a stream titled "LIVE BLAHAJ UNBOXING!!".
After the stream is finished, Ryan puts Blahaj back in the crate and goes to sleep.

...

The next morning, Ryan wakes up to see that Blahaj has become an internet star overnight. Everyone wants Blahaj, and
thus Ryan decides to sell Blahaj to make some quick bucks.

The end.
